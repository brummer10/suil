Suil
----

Suil is a library for LV2 hosts intended to make using LV2 plugin UIs as
as simple as possible, including support for hosting a UI in any supported
toolkit in a host written in another supported toolkit.

Suil insulates hosts from toolkit libraries used by plugin UIs, for example a
Gtk host can embed a Qt UI without linking against Qt at compile time.
